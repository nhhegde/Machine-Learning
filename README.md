...notice a few strange things? Good on you! Please get in touch. This project is very old. 

## Requirements

`Python3`
`scipy`

## Installation

- install python and pip3
- `pip3 install scipy`

## Usage

run `python3 K_nearest_neighbors.py`
Classifications will be written to `out.out`. 

`/digitsDataset/out.out` contains classifications for that dataset.
